This is my Library Management System
This essentially a CLI that allows for the user to manage a library's records, look information up, and return and borrow library books
When running the program you will be greeted with a welceme message and a menu

-"Welcome to the Library Management System!
-"Main Menu"
-1. Book Operations
-2. User Operations
-3. Author Operations
-4. Genre Operations
-5. Quit
-"Select an option"

You will be prompted to choose an option...
with any option that you choose you will be taken to another menu that allows the user more utility in that category

choice 1
-"Book Operations"
-1. Add new book
-2. Borrow a book
-3. Return a book
-4. Search for a book
-5. Display all books
-"Select an option

choice 2
-"User Operations"
-1. Add new user
-2. View user details
-3. Display all users
-"Selec an option"

choice 3
-"Author Operations"
-1. Add new author
-2. View author details
-3. Display all authors
-"Select an option"

choice 4
-"Genre Operations"
-1. Add new genre
-2. View genre details
-3. Display all genres
-"Select an option"

For the book operations menu or the first choice, the user can add, borrow, return, search and display books.
For the second choice the user operations menu, the user can add, check details and see a list of all the users registered to the library. You must be a user in order to borrow a book. 
Third choice, the author operations menu allows you to add new authors to the library's database. You can also view details and display all authors in the database from this menu.
Fourth choice, the genre operations menu allows the user to create a genre along with a description of what that genre is. You can also view details and display all the genres that have been made.
There is a fifth choice that does not come along with a menu. This is the choice to quit the program. If the user should choose the fifth option, there will be a good-bye message displayed and the program will terminate.

That pretty much sums up the utility and what you can more or less expect from running the program.
